Shaped charges were developed for tank killing, used in MBT anti-armor rounds and antitank weapons. Their warheads are basically thick cups of soft metal. Metals with low melting points, usually copper. The bomb-maker\'s job is to make sure as much of the force of the blast is channeled to the copper cone as possible. So sometimes he\'ll put several 155mm shells beneath the copper, or pack a whole lot of TNT under it.\nAMR graph:(m / multi-sentence\n      :snt1 (i / infer-01\n            :ARG1 (h / have-condition-91\n                  :ARG1 (g / goal\n                        :poss y\n                        :domain (f / find-01\n                              :ARG0 (y / you)\n                              :ARG1 (w / way\n                                    :manner-of (k / kill-01\n                                          :ARG1 (v / vehicle :wiki "M1_Abrams" :name (n / name :op1 "M1"))))))\n                  :ARG2 (m2 / make-01\n                        :ARG0 (i2 / insurgent\n                              :domain y)\n                        :ARG1 (b / bomb))))\n      :snt2 (c / contrast-01\n            :ARG1 (k2 / knock-off-05\n                  :ARG1 (t / tread)\n                  :mod (j / just :polarity -))\n            :ARG2 (a / and\n                  :op1 (d / destroy-01\n                        :ARG1 t)\n                  :op2 (k3 / kill-01\n                        :ARG1 (c2 / crew))))\n      :snt3 (a2 / and\n            :op2 (c3 / come-in-07\n                  :ARG1 (d4 / device\n                        :ARG1-of (i3 / improvise-01)\n                        :ARG1-of (e2 / explode-01\n                              :ARG1-of (p / possible-01))\n                        :mod (s / shape-01\n                              :ARG1 (c4 / charge)))\n                  :location (t2 / that)))\n      :snt4 (a3 / and\n            :op1 (d2 / develop-02\n                  :ARG1 (c5 / charge\n                        :ARG1-of (s2 / shape-01))\n                  :ARG4 (k4 / kill-01\n                        :ARG1 (t3 / tank)))\n            :op2 (u / use-01\n                  :ARG1 c5\n                  :ARG2 (a4 / and\n                        :op1 (r / round\n                              :ARG0-of (c6 / counter-01\n                                    :ARG1 (a5 / armor))\n                              :mod (t7 / tank\n                                    :mod (m6 / main)\n                                    :ARG0-of (b6 / battle-01)))\n                        :op2 (w2 / weapon\n                              :ARG0-of (c7 / counter-01\n                                    :ARG1 t3)))))\n      :snt5 (c8 / cup\n            :ARG1-of (t4 / thick-03)\n            :consist-of (m3 / metal\n                  :ARG1-of (s3 / soft-02))\n            :mod (b2 / basic)\n            :domain (w3 / warhead\n                  :part-of (t5 / they)))\n      :snt6 (m4 / metal\n            :example (c9 / copper\n                  :mod (u2 / usual))\n            :ARG1-of (l / low-04\n                  :ARG2 (p2 / point\n                        :mod (m5 / melt-01))))\n      :snt8 (c13 / cause-01\n            :ARG1 (o / or\n                  :op1 (p6 / put-01\n                        :ARG0 (h2 / he)\n                        :ARG1 (s5 / shell\n                              :quant (s6 / several)\n                              :mod (d3 / distance-quantity :quant 155\n                                    :unit (m8 / millimeter)))\n                        :ARG2 (b5 / beneath\n                              :op1 (c14 / copper))\n                        :time (s7 / sometimes))\n                  :op2 (p7 / pack-01\n                        :ARG0 h2\n                        :ARG1 (t6 / trinitrotoluene\n                              :quant (l2 / lot\n                                    :degree (w4 / whole)))\n                        :location (u3 / under\n                              :op1 c14))))\n      :snt7 (j2 / job\n            :poss p4\n            :domain (e / ensure-01\n                  :ARG0 (p4 / person\n                        :ARG0-of (m7 / make-01\n                              :ARG1 (b3 / bomb)))\n                  :ARG1 (c10 / channel-01\n                        :ARG1 (f2 / force-04\n                              :ARG0 (b4 / blast-01)\n                              :quant (a6 / as-much-as\n                                    :op1 (p5 / possible-01)))\n                        :ARG2 (c11 / cone\n                              :consist-of (c12 / copper))))))', 'Generate an Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graph for the following sentence: Is it possible to go from nc55 to nc45?\nAMR graph:(p / possible-01\n      :ARG1 (g / go-01\n            :ARG3 (p2 / product :wiki -
